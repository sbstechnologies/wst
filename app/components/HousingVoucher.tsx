                Western Station at Fossil Creek Apartments, located at 6700
                Sandshell Blvd, Fort Worth, Texas welcomes applicants and
                residents participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program
                and other rental assistance programs, subject to unit
                availability, standard screening criteria, applicable income and
                rent restrictions, Public Housing Authority (PHA) approval
                requirements, and all applicable program guidelines.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our community does not deny housing solely because an applicant
                or household participates in the Housing Choice Voucher Program
                or receives rental assistance. For voucher households, any
                minimum income requirement applies only to the tenant-paid
                portion of rent and will not exceed 250% of that amount.
              </p>

              <p>
                Western Station at Fossil Creek Apartments actively markets both
                restricted and unrestricted apartment homes to eligible voucher
                households and works with local housing authorities to ensure
                equal access to available housing opportunities.
